We are releasing Italian HyperPartisan and Pragmatics (IHPP), a dataset for hyperpartisan italian news on climate change, Ukraine war, EU institutions and immigration.
The dataset is divided into train (IHPPC_train.json) and test (IHPP_test.json), that can be found in /data.

The dataset can be used to reproduce our findings. 
The annotation guidelines will be released after the review, since LREC did not allow for extra-materials (e.g. Appendix).
