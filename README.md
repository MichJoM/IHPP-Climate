We are releasing Italian HyperPartisan and Pragmatics (IHPP), a dataset for hyperpartisan italian news on climate change, Ukraine war, EU institutions and immigration.
The dataset is divided into train (train.json) and test (test.json).

The annotation guidelines will be released after the review, since LREC did not allow for extra-materials (e.g. Appendix).


The dataset can be used to reproduce our findings and for further research.
This dataset is intended for non-commercial academic and research purposes. Please cite the original news outlets and this dataset if used in publications or analysis.
